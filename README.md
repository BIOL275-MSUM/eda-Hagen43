## Abstract

Health Factors is a way to measure the overall health of a specific
population. Two things that contribute to Health Factors are
socioeconomics and health behaviors. For my project I plan on exploring
how socioeconomic variables correlate with negative health behaviors
across the counties of North Dakota. I plan to study variables such as
obesity, excessive drinking, and adult smoking and how they could
potentially be derived from socioeconomic variables. I expect to see a
direct correlation of my variables, if this is found it would allow us
to be able to create support centers in the counties that need it.

## Introduction

Many Americans across the country face health problems. Many of these
issues stem from poor health habits such as smoking, excessive drinking,
or lack of physical activity. This has caused countless deaths around
our country. These behaviors have even been deemed a country wide
epidemic. However, what do these poor habits stem from an outside
source? For my project I test exactly that. I hypothesize that negative
socioeconomic variables have a strong correlation to these negative
health behaviors. To test this hypothesis I pulled county data from the
state of North Dakota. If my hypothesis is found to be plausible this
would allow us to create centers of support. These centers would provide
assistance to individuals that suffer negative socioeconomic variables
to avoid developing negative health behaviors.

## Methods

### Data Acquisition

For my project I needed to pull data from a source that has data on
individual counties of North Dakota. I pulled this data from the county
health rankings website (County Health Rankings & Roadmaps 2020). This
data is free to see if you go to the website.

### Data Description

My data consists of 54 rows, each row representing a different county in
North Dakota. The variables I chose to use from the data set:

  - Percent Fair/Poor Health: Numerical Continuous
  - Percent Smokers: Numerical Continuous
  - Percent Adults with Obesity: Numerical Continuous
  - Percent Excessive Drinking: Numerical Continuous
  - Percent Physically Inactive: Numerical Continuous
  - Percent Unemployed: Numerical Continuous
  - Percent Severe Housing Problems: Numerical Continuous
  - Percent Income Ratio: Numerical Continuous
  - Violent Crime Rate: Numerical Continuous.

I selected these variables because they each show the percent of the
population in each county that falls under that specific variable. This
allowed me to compare my variables as a population rather than specific
individuals.

### Data Preparation

I was only able to download the data through excel.I had to make the
data able to do so I used Rstudio version 1.3.1093 (RStudio Team 2020)
which is in R version 4.0.3(R Core Team 2020) To make the data able to
use I had to run two packages dplyr (Wickham et al. 2020) and readxl
(Wickham and Bryan 2019). I then had to save the excel spreadsheet to a
specific file to load up in my code. I used the function read\_excel
which allowed me to download my data. I then used sheet and skip within
that function to allow me to roughly select specific data. The data
contained many variables I was not interested in, which I removed. The
ones I kept were: FIPS, State, County, Deaths, Percent Fair/Poor Health,
Percent Smokers, Percent Adults with Obesity, Percent Excessive
Drinking, Percent Physically Inactive, Percent Unemployed, Percent
Severe Housing Problems, Percent Income Ratio, and Percent Violent Crime
Rate.

## Results

To create my figures I used functions: corrplot (Wei and Simko 2017) and
ggplot2 (Wickham 2016).

Figure 1. shows the correlation between all of the variables that I
examined.

Figure 2. shows the correlation between Excessive Drinking and violent
crimes. We can see a the distribution trends positively.

Figure 3. shows the correlation between smokers and housing problems. We
can see the distrubtion trends postively.

Figure 4. shows the correlation between fair or poor health and violent
crime. We can see the distribution is spread with little to no trend.

## Dicussion

To examine my data I used a correlation plot (Wei and Simko 2017). This
allowed me to compare the correlation of all of my variables. Seeing the
correlation of variables allowed me to decipher which socioeconomic
influences had a direct affect on negative health behaviors. From Figure
1 we can see that there is correlation between Excessive
Drinking/violent crime, smoking/housing problems, and a negative
correlation between Fair or poor health/violent crime.

In figure 2 we can see the correlation of excessive drinking and violent
crimes across North Dakota counties. To do this I used scatter plots
(Wickham 2016) to compare the two vaiables. The outliers are due to the
variety of population across the counties, and violent crime being
higher in counties with a higher population. Figure 3 we see another
positive correlation, this time it is between smoking and housing
problems. This was interesting to me because housing problems usually
stem from low income areas. This tells us that the biggest smokers are
in lower income areas. Figure 4 showed us that there was a negative
correlation between fair and poor health and violent crimes. This could
be due to a handful of things. However, by examining the data I believe
that areas that report higher levels of fair or poor health stem from
higher income areas, where violent crime is less prevalent.

In conclusion we can see that socioeconomic factors have very little
correlation between negative health behaviors, aside from a few. This
implicates that poor health behaviors are not dependent on an
individuals living situation, but more dependent on knowledge of the
issue. Moving forward we should provide proper education that will
prevent poor health behaviors.
