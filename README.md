## Abstract

Health Factors is a way to measure the overall health of a specific
population. Two things that contribute to Health Factors are
socioeconomics and health behaviors. For my project I plan on exploring
how socioeconomic variables correlate with negative health behaviors
across the counties of North Dakota. I plan to study variables such as
obesity, excessive drinking, and adult smoking and how they could
potentially be derived from socioeconomic variables. I expect to see a
direct correlation of my variables, if this is found it would allow us
to be able to create support centers in the counties that need it.
