## Abstract

Health Factors is a way to measure the overall health of a specific population. Two things that contribute to Health Factors are socioeconomics and health behaviors. For my project I plan on exploring how socioeconomic variables correlate with negative health behaviors across the counties of North Dakota. I plan to study variables such as obesity, excessive drinking, and adult smoking and how they could potentially be derived from socioeconomic variables. I expect to see a direct correlation of my variables, if this is found it would allow us to be able to create support centers in the counties that need it. 

## Methods
