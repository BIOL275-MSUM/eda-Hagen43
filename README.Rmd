## Affects of Socioeconomics on Health

## Abstract

Health Factors is a way to measure the overall health of a specific population. Two things that contribute to Health Factors are socioeconomics and health behaviors. For my project I plan on exploring how socioeconomic variables correlate with negative health behaviors across the counties of North Dakota. I plan to study variables such as obesity, excessive drinking, and adult smoking and how they could potentially be derived from socioeconomic variables. I expect to see a direct correlation of my variables, if this is found it would allow us to be able to create support centers in the counties that need it. 

## Introduction

  Many Americans across the country face health problems. Many of these issues stem from poor health habits such as smoking, excessive drinking, or lack of physical activity. This has caused countless deaths around our country. These behaviors have even been deemed a country  wide epidemic. However, what do these poor habits stem from an outside source? For my project I test exactly that. I hypothesize that negative socioeconomic variables have a strong correlation to these negative health behaviors. To test this hypothesis I pulled county data from the state of North Dakota. 
  If my hypothesis is found to be plausible this would allow centers of support. These centers would provide assistance to individuals that suffer negative socioeconomic variables to avoid developing negative health behaviors.
  
## Methods

### Data Acquisition

  For my project I needed to pull data from a source that has data on individual counties of North Dakota. I pulled this data from the county health rankings website (County Health Rankings & Roadmaps 2020). This data is free to see if you go to the website. 
  
### Data Description

  My data consists of 54 rows, each row representing a different county in North Dakota. The variables I chose to use from the data set: 
  
 - Percent Fair/Poor Health: Numerical Continuous 
 - Percent Smokers: Numerical Continuous
 - Percent Adults with Obesity: Numerical Continuous
 - Percent Excessive Drinking: Numerical Continuous 
 - Percent Physically Inactive: Numerical Continuous 
 - Percent Unemployed: Numerical Continuous
 - Percent Severe Housing Problems: Numerical Continuous
 - Percent Income Ratio: Numerical Continuous
 - Violent Crime Rate: Numerical Continuous.
  
I selected these variables because they each show the percent of the population in each county that falls under that specific variable. This allowed me to compare my variables as a population rather than specific individuals. 

  
### Data Preparation

  I was only able to download the data through excel.I had to make the data able to do so I used Rstudio version 1.3.1093 (RStudio Team 2020) which is in R version 4.0.3(R Core Team 2020) To make the data able to use I had to run two packages dplyr (Wickham et al. 2020) and readxl (Wickham and Bryan 2019). I then had to save the excel spreadsheet to a specific file to load up in my code. I used the function read_excel which allowed me to download my data. I then used sheet and skip within that function to allow me to roughly select specific data. The data contained many variables I was not interested in, which I removed. The ones I kept were: FIPS, State, County, Deaths, Percent Fair/Poor Health, Percent Smokers, Percent Adults with Obesity, Percent Excessive Drinking, Percent Physically Inactive, Percent Unemployed, Percent Severe Housing Problems, Percent Income Ratio, and Percent Violent Crime Rate.   

## Results 

  To create my figures I used functions: corrplot (Wei and Simko 2017) and ggplot2 (Wickham 2016).
  
  
```{r Fig. 1}
Ranked_meas_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(County)) %>%
  select(-FIPS,-State,-County,-Deaths) %>%
  cor(use = "na.or.complete") %>%
  corrplot(
    method = "color",
    type = "upper",
    order = "hclust",
    tl.col = "black",
    tl.srt = 45,
    addCoef.col = "black"
  ) 
```
 
  Figure 1. shows the correlation between all of the variables that I examined. 
  
```{r Fig. 2}
ggplot(Ranked_meas_data, aes(x=Violent_Crime, y=Excess_Drinking)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = TRUE)
```
  
  Figure 2. shows the correlation between Excessive Drinking and violent crimes. We can see a the distribution trends positively. 
```{r Fig. 3}
ggplot(Ranked_meas_data, aes(x = Housing_Problems, y = Smokers)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = TRUE)
```
  
  Figure 3. shows the correlation between smokers and housing problems. We can see the distrubtion trends postively.
```{r Fig. 4}
ggplot(Ranked_meas_data, aes(x = Violent_Crime, y = FP_health)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = TRUE)
```
  
  Figure 4. shows the correlation between fair or poor health and violent crime. We can see the distribution is spread with little to no trend.
